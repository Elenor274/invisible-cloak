## ⚡ What is this?

This Python project makes anything **red** in front of your webcam completely **disappear**,  
by replacing it with the captured background — creating a magical cloak effect! 🪄

It uses:
- OpenCV for real-time video processing
- Color masking & background subtraction
- A sprinkle of code magic 😉

---

## 🧠 How it works

1. Captures a clean background frame (while you're out of the frame)
2. Detects red-colored areas in each frame
3. Replaces those red areas with the background

✅ No filters  
✅ No editing  
✅ Just pure Python + OpenCV

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the program

```bash
python Invisibility\ Cloak.py
```

- Wait 3–5 seconds for background capture  
- Then hold a red cloth in front of the webcam and... **vanish!**
